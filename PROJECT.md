# overview of the project
- Building approvals in Kenya vary based on factors like project type, size, estimated expenses, and location. Counties operate their own system for reviewing and [granting permits](https://www.buyrentkenya.com/discover/step-by-step-process-of-obtaining-building-permits-in-kenya#:~:text=There%20are%20four%20mandatory%20construction,EIA%20license%2FNEMA%20approval), adding complexity to the process.
- Construction approvals' procedures, regulations, and associated costs vary significantly depending on factors such as the type of structure, its size, estimated expenses, and its geographical location.
- There are four mandatory construction approvals in Kenya:
    - Architectural plan approval
    - Structural plan approval
    - EIA license/NEMA approval
    - NCA project registration

- This list is not exhaustive but represents the standard prerequisites for most building developments across Kenyan counties before construction begins.
